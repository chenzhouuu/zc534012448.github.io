Welcome! I'm a second year PHD student in Industrial Engineering department working on AI for healthcare and manufacturing systems.

<p style="color:#000000">Research interests</p>: I am interested in solving the global sustainability challenges by combining machine learning and large scale molecular simulation. I believe it requires integrated innovations in three aspects: 1) designing physics motivated machine learning algorithms; 2) creating infrastructure for large scale molecular simulation; and 3) inventing new collaborative frameworks between computational and experimental experts. I work with a highly interdiscripnary team to rethink the paradigm for materials discovery, aiming for solving sustainability related problems with real-world impact.
